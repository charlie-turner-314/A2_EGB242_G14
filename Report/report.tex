\section{Introduction}

After the chief at Brisbane-based Australian Space Agency (BASA) have reviewed
previous tasks, they have decided to assign the team `live' supervision of the
MARS-242 mission.

Communication between the ground and the mission must be clear and
uninterrupted to ensure the mission is safe and smooth. There are three
important tasks to be completed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Identifying an appropriate landing site for the crew
    \item[-] Ensuring the safety of the Martian habitats for the current and future crews
\end{itemize}

\noindent To achieve these objectives, the team must be able to properly interpret and
analyse data streams from a rover scouting the surface prior to landing.
The landing site must be identified despite periodic and bandlimited noise
disrupting signal streams. Once a landing site is determined, the acoustic
properties of the habitat's rooms must be analysed, removing interference and
noise arising from the communication channel and method.
